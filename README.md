# mandelbrot-analysis

The mandelbrot set is one of the most famous sets in mathematics. However, as seen below, it is highly discontinuous and determining the boundary is nontrivial. This repository contributes to the understanding of the Mandelbrot Set by computing its convex hull, the smallest convex set that contains it.
