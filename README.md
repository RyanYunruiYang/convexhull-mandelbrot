# mandelbrot-analysis

The mandelbrot set is one of the most famous sets in mathematics. However, as seen below, it is highly discontinuous and determining the boundary is nontrivial. This repository contributes to the understanding of the Mandelbrot Set by computing its convex hull, the smallest convex set that contains it.

There are several interesting questions that we leave to future mathematicians:
(1) Are there a finite number of points in the convex hull of the Mandelbrot Set?
(2) Does the Mandelbrot Set intersect its convex hull at non-vertex points?
(3) Does the area of the convex hull of the Mandelbrot Set approach a value?
